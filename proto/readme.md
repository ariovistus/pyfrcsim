what's this? where did it come from?

protobuf stuff. 

some of it came from allwpilib/simulation/gz_msgs (https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/master/simulation/gz_msgs/src/main/proto)
these ones get generated into gazebo/gz_msgs
because organization
some of it came from gazebo (https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo) (look in gazebo/msgs)
these ones get generated into gazebo/msgs

all are unmodified from their respective sources, but will need to be synced up if there are changes
